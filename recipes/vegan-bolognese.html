            <li>1 medium carrot, roughly chopped (1 carrot yields ~1/4 cup or 60 g)</li>
            <li>4 large cloves garlic (4 large cloves yield ~2 Tbsp or 18 g)</li>
            <li>3-4 Tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>8 oz. whole baby bella or cremini mushrooms</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 ½ – 2 tsp sea salt</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
            <li>1 (28-oz.) can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
            <li>1/2 cup uncooked red lentils</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped fresh basil (optional but recommended)</li>
            <li>12 oz. dry pasta, ideally a short tube shape like rigatoni or penne (gluten-free as needed)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade lasagna:
            <ol>
                <li>Peel and roughly chop the onion, carrot, and garlic and add them to a food processor. Pulse until finely chopped. Alternatively, finely chop by hand.</li>
                <li>Heat the olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the finely chopped onion, carrot, and garlic and sauté until translucent and soft, stirring occasionally.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, add the mushrooms to the food processor and pulse until finely chopped (or chop by hand). Add the chopped mushrooms to the pan and cook for 3-4 minutes until starting to brown. Next add the tomato paste, sea salt (starting with the lesser amount), and optional crushed red pepper flakes and cook for about 1 minute, stirring constantly.</li>
                <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, water, and lentils. Bring the sauce to a boil and cover the pan. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for ~30 minutes, stirring about every 10 minutes, until the sauce has thickened and the lentils are tender and starting to break down. Then stir in the optional chopped basil and turn off the heat. Taste and adjust as needed, adding more tomato paste for richness or salt to taste.</li>
                <li>When the sauce is nearly done, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Once boiling, add the pasta and cook according to package instructions, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.</li>
                <li>Once the pasta is al dente (tender with a little bite), drain it and divide between your serving bowls. Top with your desired amount of sauce and garnish with vegan parmesan cheese and more fresh basil (both optional).</li>
                <li>Leftover sauce will keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days or in the freezer for up to 1 month.</li>
            </ol>
