# oding-recipes
Abstract: 

The goal of this project is to build a website containing Recipes that the user can navigate to.

Finishing this project will solidify that I've learned the following things about html:

 - HTML structure
 - What elements are there and how do I use them
 - navigating to different html files
 - using images
