    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade lasagna:
            <ol>
                <li>Melt 1 tbsp coconut oil in a saucepan over a medium heat and soften 1 chopped onion for 5 mins. Add 2 grated garlic cloves and a grated thumb-sized piece of ginger, and cook for 1 min until fragrant.</li>
                <li>Stir in 3 tbsp Thai red curry paste, 1 tbsp smooth peanut butter and 500g sweet potato, peeled and cut into chunks, then add 400ml coconut milk and 200ml water.</li>
                <li>Bring to the boil, turn down the heat and simmer, uncovered, for 25-30 mins or until the sweet potato is soft.</li>
                <li>Stir through 200g spinach and the juice of 1 lime, and season well. Serve with cooked rice, and if you want some crunch, sprinkle over a few dry roasted peanuts.</li>
            </ol>
